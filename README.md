# Breast Cancer Classification using Supervised Learning

# Overview
This project evaluates the performance of five supervised learning algorithms on the breast cancer dataset from the sklearn library. The algorithms implemented are Logistic Regression, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN).

# Dataset
- *Name:* Breast Cancer Dataset
- *Source:* sklearn library
- *Description:* The dataset contains 569 samples from two classes (malignant and benign) with 30 features each.

# Implemented Algorithms
1. *Logistic Regression:* A linear model for binary classification.
2. *Decision Tree Classifier:* A tree-based model for classification.
3. *Random Forest Classifier:* An ensemble learning method for classification.
4. *Support Vector Machine (SVM):* A linear or non-linear model for classification.
5. *k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):* A distance-based model for classification.

# Code Structure
- *data_preprocessing.ipynb:* Loads and preprocesses the breast cancer dataset.
- *classification_algorithms.ipynb:* Implements and trains the five classification algorithms.
- *model_comparison.ipynb:* Compares the performance of the five algorithms.

# Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
